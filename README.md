# CalCast

## Short Description

Create and Book calls with reputation gating in Farcaster using Frames

## Project Screenshots

## Problem Statement

Farcaster has become the social media hub of web3 where people post/interact and get in touch with people in this space. When you want to talk to someone or get on a call with them, we still rely on external applications like Calendly, cal.com etc. Even though it provides the good UX posible, it is still an another unnecessary external application that collects the user data. Better UX and data ownership can be realized by using CalCast which acts as a booking feature inherently in Farcaster. Thanks to Farcaster Frames :)
